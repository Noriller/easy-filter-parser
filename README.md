# EasyFilterParser

üéà Welcome to **EasyFilterParser**! üëã

EasyFilterParser is a lightweight ‚òÅÔ∏è, zero dependencies üö¢, minimal setup üòÆ, intuitive üòÉ and powerful üí™ parser used in the EasyFilter trilogy packages.

It's as easy as this:
```js
  const parser = EasyFilterParser()
  const { options, searchTree } = parser.search('your query')
```

## Get Started

### Use your choice of package manager

```bash
npm install @noriller/easy-filter-parser
```

```bash
yarn add @noriller/easy-filter-parser
```

### Then import it with the syntax of your choice

```js
import EasyFilterParser from '@noriller/easy-filter-parser'
```

```js
const EasyFilterParser = require('@noriller/easy-filter-parser')
```

### Finally, to actually use it

```js
  const parser = EasyFilterParser()
  const { options, searchTree } = parser.search('your query')
```

That's it! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Check out the section [EasyFilterParser Operators](#easyfilter-parser-operators) to see all that you can pass to the filter, the real ‚ú®magic‚ú® is there!

```js
‚ú® Magic like turning this:
  `search for something "this between quotes" and then here:"you search for this"`
‚ú®
  Into something that works for single values, quoted values and even values nested inside keys. AND MORE!
‚ú®
```

#### Really? That's it?

Ok. If you need more options, here's the full setup you can do using all options available:

```js
const parser = EasyFilterParser({
    filterOptions: {
      dateFormat: 'DD-MM-YYYY',
      normalize: true,
      indexing: true,
      limit: 10,
    },
    tagAliases: {
      tag: ['tag1', 'tag2', 'tag3'],
    }
  })

const { options, searchTree } = parser.search('your query')
```

It's still that simple. üë®‚Äçüíª

All the options will be explained in [EasyFilterParser Options](#easyfilter-parser-options).
And most of them you can pass in the `search` üîé string when you need.

## Inspirations and motivation

In corporate scenarios, sometimes we have too much information üòµ. We make pages with endless columns and if we need to filter that data, we either use something generic like `Object.keys(object).join(' ').includes('string')` or we have to make a custom search... for. each. table. üò´

Meanwhile I saw awesome (and probably custom solutions) in things we use everyday.

Check out the ones I was aiming for üåü:
* Github
* Stackoverflow
* Gmail/Google Search

In the latter, users can use their UI to create their queries while powerusers can just type that and much more.

I too needed to provide a way to users to filter the data and ended up settling at a simpler version of this project. Mostly because of all the solutions I was able to find were neither user or developer friendly. üò¢

(Also a little rant: `search`, `filter`, `matcher` and the like are a nightmare to search for... too many hits and too little relevant results üòï)

This is what I'm trying to offer here: a powerful engine to make your queries. üòéüëç

Then it's up to you to offer a UI for what makes sense for your data. And it's still intuitive for common users and powerful for powerusers.

## EasyFilterParser Operators

Most of this should be intuitive for most users... that's what I was aiming for after all. üßê
### OR query

Any word or operators are, primarily and lastly, treated as `OR` queries.

```js
parser.search('word1 word2 tag:value "quoted value"')
```
```js
// Returns:
{
  options: {},
  searchTree: [
      {
        payload: 'quoted value',
        mode: 'QUOTE',
        childs:
          [
            { payload: 'quoted', mode: 'OR', childs: undefined },
            { payload: 'value', mode: 'OR', childs: undefined }
          ]
      },
      {
        payload: 'value',
        tag: 'tag',
        mode: 'TAG',
        childs: [{ payload: 'value', mode: 'OR', childs: undefined }],
        aliases: {}
      },
      { payload: 'word1', mode: 'OR', childs: undefined },
      { payload: 'word2', mode: 'OR', childs: undefined }
    ]
}
```
`word1`, `word2`, `tag:value` and `"quoted value"` each become separated entities.

### AND query

Anything inside quotes (either double `"` or single `'`) will be treated as one entity.

```js
parser.search('"quoted value tag:value"')
```
```js
//Returns:
{
  options: {},
  searchTree:
    [{
      payload: 'quoted value tag:value',
      mode: 'QUOTE',
      childs:
        [
          {
            payload: 'value',
            tag: 'tag',
            mode: 'TAG',
            childs: [{ payload: "value", mode: "OR" }],
            aliases: {}
          },
          { payload: 'quoted', mode: 'OR', childs: undefined },
          { payload: 'value', mode: 'OR', childs: undefined }
        ]
    }]
}
```
`quoted`, `value` and `tag:value` became an `AND` query.

And in this case, both `quoted` and `value` become `OR` queries and `tag:value` becomes `TAG` query.

#### AND Remarks

An `AND` query can contain: `OR`, `TAG` and even nested `AND` queries.

In case of nested `TAG` and `AND` queries, the nested quote must not match the parent quote.

### TAG query

TAG here is equivalent to any `key` of a Javascript object.

#### TAG Remarks

A `TAG` query can contain: `OR`, `AND` and then `NULL` and `RANGE`/`DATE_RANGE` queries.

`TAG` doesn't support nested `TAG` queries.

#### Types of TAG queries with Examples:
##### TAG - Simple
```js
parser.search('tag:value')
```
```js
//Returns:
{
  options: {},
  searchTree:
    [{
      payload: 'value',
      tag: 'tag',
      mode: 'TAG',
      childs: [{ payload: 'value', mode: 'OR', childs: undefined }],
      aliases: {}
    }]
}
```
Just the `TAG` followed by a colon and the `value`.

`value` in this example will become an `OR` query.

##### TAG - OR
```js
parser.search('tag:(value1 value2 value3)')
```
```js
//Returns:
{
  options: {},
  searchTree:
    [{
      payload: 'value1 value2 value3',
      tag: 'tag',
      mode: 'TAG',
      childs:
        [
          { payload: 'value1', mode: 'OR', childs: undefined },
          { payload: 'value2', mode: 'OR', childs: undefined },
          { payload: 'value3', mode: 'OR', childs: undefined }
        ],
      aliases: {}
    }]
}
```
By using brackets, you can have an `OR` query with multiple values at once.

##### TAG - AND
```js
parser.search('tag:"value1 value2 value3"')
```
```js
//Returns:
{
  options: {},
  searchTree:
    [{
      payload: '"value1 value2 value3"',
      tag: 'tag',
      mode: 'TAG',
      childs:
        [{
          payload: 'value1 value2 value3',
          mode: 'QUOTE',
          childs: [
            { payload: "value1", mode: "OR" },
            { payload: "value2", mode: "OR" },
            { payload: "value3", mode: "OR" }
          ]
        }],
      aliases: {}
    }]
}
```
By using quotes (single/double), you can have an `AND` query.

##### TAG - Null Values
```js
parser.search('tag:null tag:nil tag:none tag:nothing')
```
```js
//Returns:
{
  options: {},
  searchTree:
    [
      {
        payload: 'null',
        tag: 'tag',
        mode: 'TAG_NULL',
        childs: [{ payload: 'null', mode: 'OR', childs: undefined }],
        aliases: {}
      },
      {
        payload: 'nil',
        tag: 'tag',
        mode: 'TAG_NULL',
        childs: [{ payload: 'nil', mode: 'OR', childs: undefined }],
        aliases: {}
      },
      {
        payload: 'none',
        tag: 'tag',
        mode: 'TAG_NULL',
        childs: [{ payload: 'none', mode: 'OR', childs: undefined }],
        aliases: {}
      },
      {
        payload: 'nothing',
        tag: 'tag',
        mode: 'TAG_NULL',
        childs: [{ payload: 'nothing', mode: 'OR', childs: undefined }],
        aliases: {}
      }
    ]
}
```
By passing, alone, any of the words: `NULL`, `NIL`, `NONE` or `NOTHING` as the value of the `TAG`, it will create a `TAG_NULL` that can be used to search nullish values.

`tag:(nothing)`, in contrast, will create a normal `TAG` query.

##### TAG - Chaining Tags
```js
parser.search('tag.subTag.thirdTag:value')
```
```js
//Returns:
{
  options: {},
  searchTree:
    [{
      payload: 'value',
      tag: 'tag.subTag.thirdTag',
      mode: 'TAG',
      childs: [{ payload: 'value', mode: 'OR', childs: undefined }],
      aliases: {}
    }]
}
```
You can chain tags together using a `.` (full stop/period).

This would be equivalent to nested `TAGs`. (Nested tags aren't supported.)

##### TAG - Arrays
```js
parser.search('tag.0:value tag2.*.subTag:value')
```
```js
//Returns:
{
  options: {},
  searchTree:
    [
      {
        payload: 'value',
        tag: 'tag.0',
        mode: 'TAG',
        childs: [{ payload: 'value', mode: 'OR', childs: undefined }],
        aliases: {}
      },
      {
        payload: 'value',
        tag: 'tag2.*.subTag',
        mode: 'TAG',
        childs: [{ payload: 'value', mode: 'OR', childs: undefined }],
        aliases: {}
      }
    ]
}
```
As a use case in [EasyFilter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@noriller/easy-filter), arrays are supported.

The main difference is that the `key` they use are numerical and ordered.

`tag.0:value` and `tag2.*.subTag:value` have the same syntax as a normal chaining and the difference will happen in the filter implementation.

##### TAG - RANGE
```js
parser.search('tag:range(0,5)')
```
```js
//Returns:
{
  options: {},
  searchTree:
    [{
      payload: 'range(0,5)',
      tag: 'tag',
      mode: 'TAG',
      childs:
        [{
          payload: null,
          range: [0, 5],
          mode: 'RANGE',
          childs: undefined
        }],
      aliases: {}
    }]
}
```
By passing, alone, the operator `RANGE()` you can pass one or two arguments that will filter based on the numbers.

`RANGE` can only be used inside `TAG` and with `number` values.

The first argument is the lower bound (`-Infinity` as default) and the second argument is the upper bound (`Infinity` as default).

Passing only one argument sets only the lower bound. To set only the upper bound, pass it empty: `RANGE(,5)`.

##### TAG - DATE_RANGE
```js
parser.search('tag:dateRange(2020-05-01, 2021-09-05)')
```
```js
//Returns:
{
  options: {},
  searchTree: [
    {
      aliases: {},
      childs: [
        {
          childs: undefined,
          mode: 'DATE_RANGE',
          payload: null,
          // the range return is actually: "2020-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","2021-09-05T00:00:00.000Z"
          // but it usually shows as a locale date string
          range: [new Date('2020-05-01'), new Date('2021-09-05')],
        },
      ],
      mode: 'TAG',
      payload: 'dateRange(2020-05-01, 2021-09-05)',
      tag: 'dates',
    },
  ],
}
```
By passing, alone, the operator `DATERANGE()` you can pass one or two arguments that will filter based on the dates.

`DATERANGE` can only be used inside `TAG` and with `date` values.

The first argument is the lower bound (`0000-01-01` as default) and the second argument is the upper bound (`9999-01-01` as default).

Passing only one argument sets only the lower bound. To set only the upper bound, pass it empty: `DATERANGE(,2021-09-05)`.

More on accepted `Date Formats` in [Date Format (Query)](#dateformat-query), but you can use all the common formats like `DD/MM/YYYY`, `MM/DD/YYYY` and `YYYY/MM/DD` as long as you pass it as an `OPTION`. If no `Date Format` is provided, the Javascript default implementation of `new Date('your date string')` will be used.

### NOT query

By nesting any and multiple queries inside the syntax `NOT()` you can invert those and it will NOT return anything that matches.

#### NOT Remarks

A `NOT` query can contain: `OR`, `AND` and `TAG` queries.

All `NOT` are parsed at the same level, nesting it inside other queries will just remove them from the query.

#### NOT Example:
```js
parser.search('not("quoted value tag:value")')
```
```js
//Returns:
{
  options: {},
  searcTree: [{
    payload: "\"quoted value tag:value\"",
    mode: "NOT",
    childs: [
      {
        payload: "quoted value tag:value",
        mode: "QUOTE",
        childs: [
          {
            payload: "value",
            tag: "tag",
            mode: "TAG",
            childs: [{ payload: "value", mode: "OR" }],
            aliases: {}
          },
          { payload: "quoted", mode: "OR" },
          { payload: "value", mode: "OR" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }]
}
```

### EasyFilterParser Options

There's three types of options:
* Those that can be passed any time:
  * [Normalize](#normalize)
  * [Indexing](#indexing)
  * [Limit](#limit)
* Those that can only be passed in the setup:
  * [Filter Options](#filter-options)
    * [Date Format (Setup)](#dateformat-setup)
  * [Tag Aliases](#tag-aliases)
* Those that can only be passed with the query:
  * [Date Format (Query)](#dateformat-query)
#### OPTION keyword

Using the syntax `OPTION()` or `OPTIONS()` you can pass the following options inside your search string.

The `OPTION` keyword is parsed first, it will be just removed if nested in other queries and anything else inside will be either parsed as an option or ignored.

##### DATEFORMAT (Query)

When passed as an `OPTION`, `DateFormat` will be used to parse the dates used in [`DATE_RANGE`](#tag---date_range).

This way your users can use their locale date format in their query.

When using `DATE_RANGE`, if no `DateFormat` is passed as an option the Javascript default implementation of `new Date('your date string')` will be used.

The formats can be: `YYYY-MM-DD`, `DD-MM-YYYY` and `MM-DD-YYYY` while the separators can be: `-`, `.`, `,` and `/`.

###### DateFormat Example
```js
parser.search('tag:dateRange(30-12-2020,30-12-2022) option(dateFormat:DD.MM.YYYY)')
```
```js
//Returns:
{
  options: { dateFormatSearch: 'DD.MM.YYYY' },
  searchTree:
    [{
      payload: 'dateRange(30-12-2020,30-12-2022)',
      tag: 'tag',
      mode: 'TAG',
      childs:
        [{
          payload: null,
          range:
            [new Date('2020-12-30'), new Date('2022-12-30')],
          mode: 'DATE_RANGE',
          childs: undefined
        }],
      aliases: {}
    }]
}
```

##### NORMALIZE

When the `NORMALIZE` option is used, `EasyFilterParser` will discard/ignore every and all diacritics. It's FALSE by default.

This means that with `NORMALIZE`: `Cr√®me br√ªl√©e` is equal to `Creme brulee`.

`EasyFilterParser` uses the [`string.normalize('NFD')`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/normalize) javascript API to decompose the strings and then remove all [Combining Diacritical Marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combining_Diacritical_Marks).

`NORMALIZE` uses a `boolean` flag, and when used in `OPTIONS` alone like `option(normalize)` it will assume the TRUE value, but you can explicitly use: `normalize:true`.

You can also use `normalize:false` to disable a [setup default](#filter-options) normalization for a specific query.

##### INDEXING

When the `INDEXING` option is used, the option can be used on the filter implementation to have a "relevance score" that you can use to sort the results. It's FALSE by default.

`INDEXING` uses a `boolean` flag, and when used in `OPTIONS` alone like `option(index)` or `option(indexing)` it will assume the TRUE value, but you can explicitly use: `index:true`.

You can also use `normalize:false` to disable a [setup default](#filter-options) indexing for a specific query.

##### LIMIT

When the `LIMIT` option is used, the option can be used on the filter implementation to return only the `LIMIT` number of results. It's Zero/FALSE by default.

`LIMIT` needs a `number` value, when used in `OPTIONS` you need to also pass a `number` value: `option(limit:1)`.

You can also use `limit:0` to disable a [setup default](#filter-options) limit for a specific query.
#### Setup Options

In the setup you may pass:
##### Filter Options

The following options works the same way as if passing in the query:
  * [Normalize](#normalize)
  * [Indexing](#indexing)
  * [Limit](#limit)

By passing it in the setup, they will be used in every `search`.

###### DATEFORMAT (Setup)

When passed in the `Setup`, `DateFormat` will be used to parse the dates in your `source` if your implementation uses it.

If no `DateFormat` is passed in the `setup`, the default implementation of dates will be used.

If that default implementation wouldn't work with your `source`, then provide a `DateFormat`.

The formats can be: `YYYY-MM-DD`, `DD-MM-YYYY` and `MM-DD-YYYY` while the separators can be: `-`, `.`, `,` and `/` (you can use the provided typing).

##### Tag Aliases

Pass `TAG Aliases` in the setup to expose to users more friendly (or broader) terms that they can call your data using `TAG`.

`Tag Aliases` should be a dictionary with `key`/`value` pairs where the `key` is what your users can use and the `value` is a array of strings that will refer to your actual data.

Our `data sources` might not always be the most user friendly, or something important might be nested where users couldn't possibly know. This is where you use `Tag Aliases`.

###### Aliases Examples

```js
const parse = EasyFilterParser({
    tagAliases: {
      // if you want more friendly aliases
      data: ['DT_0001X420'],
      name: ['nm_first', 'nm_last'],
      // if the important data is nested
      age: ['person.info.age'],
      // if your users expect to find everything related to a word
      address: ['address', 'city', 'country', 'province', 'zip_code'],
      // and you have no idea which words they will search for
      // just create multiple aliases with the same tags
      city: ['address', 'city', 'country', 'province', 'zip_code'],
      country: ['address', 'city', 'country', 'province', 'zip_code'],
      province: ['address', 'city', 'country', 'province', 'zip_code'],
      zip: ['address', 'city', 'country', 'province', 'zip_code'],
      location: ['address', 'city', 'country', 'province', 'zip_code'],
      where: ['address', 'city', 'country', 'province', 'zip_code'],
      position: ['address', 'city', 'country', 'province', 'zip_code'],
    }
  })
parse.search('data.address.name:something')
```
```js
//Returns:
{
  options: {},
  searchTree:
    [{
      payload: 'something',
      tag: 'data.address.name',
      mode: 'TAG',
      childs: [{ payload: 'something', mode: 'OR', childs: undefined }],
      aliases:
      {
        data: ['DT_0001X420'],
        name: ['nm_first', 'nm_last'],
        address: ['address', 'city', 'country', 'province', 'zip_code']
      }
    }]
}
```

## What else is there?

### Utils

Import with:
```js
import { removeDiacritics, cleanString, parseDate } from '@noriller/easy-filter-parser/utils'
```
OR
```js
const { removeDiacritics, cleanString, parseDate } = require('@noriller/easy-filter-parser/utils')
```

Inside there's also utils that will be used on the other packages (and that you can use too):
#### removeDiacritics

Use to remove diacritics from strings:

```js
removeDiacritics("Cr√®me br√ªl√©e")
// returns: "Creme brulee"
```
#### cleanString

 Takes a string to be cleaned, trims it and removes double spaces.

 Then, if a removeString is provided, it also removes it from the stringToClean.

```js
cleanString('  string   dirty to be   cleaned  ', '   dirty   to   be   ')
 // returns: "string cleaned"
```
#### parseDate

Expect a string that should be a date and a `DateFormat` to return a [Date.UTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/UTC) date.

If no `DateFormat` is specified, it returns the date as passed.

```js
parseDate('05-11-2020', "DD-MM-YYYY"); // returns the equivalent date as: '2020-11-05'
parseDate('05-11-2020', "MM-DD-YYYY"); // returns the equivalent date as: '2020-05-11'
parseDate('2020-11-05'); // just returns: '2020-11-05'
```

### Types

Types you use to instantiate `EasyFilterParser` are avaiable alongside the main import.

Import with:
```js
import EasyFilterParser, {
  DateFormat,
  OptionalParameters,
  SetupOptions,
  FilterOptions,
  TagAliases,
} from '@noriller/easy-filter-parser/types/shapes'
```
OR
```js
const EasyFilterParser, {
  DateFormat,
  OptionalParameters,
  SetupOptions,
  FilterOptions,
  TagAliases,
} = require('@noriller/easy-filter-parser/types/shapes')
```

Returns of the `search` method are avaiable by importing from:
```js
import {
  ParsedPart,
  ParsedRange,
  ParsedTag,
} from '@noriller/easy-filter-parser/types'
```
OR
```js
const {
  ParsedPart,
  ParsedRange,
  ParsedTag,
} = require('@noriller/easy-filter-parser/types')
```

## What's next?

Here's something you can expect in the future:

* `EasyFilterParser` will be the base of a `EasyFilter` trilogy:
  * [EasyFilter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@noriller/easy-filter) that filters Javascript objects.
  * `EasyFilterParser-SQL` - That will create SQL queries. (I'm working on this now!)
  * `EasyFilterParser-Mongo` - That will create Mongo queries. (TBD)
